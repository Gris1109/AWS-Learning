To automate EC2 backup using EBS (Elastic Block Store), you can use the following steps:

    Create an AWS IAM role with permissions to create and manage EBS snapshots. This role will be used by the EC2 instance to take snapshots of its attached EBS volumes.

    Launch an EC2 instance and attach EBS volumes that you want to back up.

    Install the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) on the EC2 instance.

    Write a script that uses the AWS CLI to create snapshots of the attached EBS volumes. The script should include the IAM role you created in step 1.

    Schedule the script to run at regular intervals using a tool like cron.
    



This script gets the instance ID from the EC2 instance's metadata service, then uses the AWS CLI to get a list of EBS volumes attached to the instance. It then loops through each volume and creates a snapshot with a description that includes the volume ID and instance ID.

You can schedule this script to run at regular intervals by adding an entry to your crontab file. For example, to run the script every day at midnight, add the following line to your crontab file:



To assign a retention period to the snapshots taken in the script above, you can add the --tag-specifications parameter to the aws ec2 create-snapshot command in the script. This parameter allows you to assign tags to the snapshot, which can be used to set a retention period.

For example, you could add a tag with the key "RetentionPeriod" and a value of "7" to indicate that the snapshot should be retained for 7 days. Here's an updated version of the script that includes this tag:


the --tag-specifications parameter is used to assign a tag to each snapshot that indicates the retention period is 7 days. This means that the snapshots will be retained for 7 days before they are automatically deleted by AWS.

You can adjust the value of the "RetentionPeriod" tag to fit your specific needs. For example, if you want to retain snapshots for 30 days, you would set the value of the tag to "30".
