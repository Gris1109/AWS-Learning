In the create_lambda.sh script, the FUNCTION_NAME variable is set to the desired name for the Lambda function, 
and the CODE_FILE variable is set to the name of the ZIP file containing the function code.
The zip command is then used to create the ZIP file, with the lambda_function.py file being added to it.
Finally, the aws lambda create-function command is used to create the Lambda function. 
The --function-name option specifies the name of the function, the --runtime option specifies the runtime environment 
(in this case, Python 3.9), the --role option specifies the ARN of the IAM role that the function will use, 
the --handler option specifies the name of the handler function (in this case, lambda_function.handler), 
and the --zip-file option specifies the location of the ZIP file containing the function code.
You can modify the script to suit your specific needs, such as changing the runtime environment or IAM role, 
or adding additional options and settings to the Lambda function.
